# ASP.NET Core Middleware
> With ASP.NET Core, nearly all functionality is bolted together using a <code>middleware pipeline</code>.

> This <code>pipeline</code> is a set of steps that all requests flow through.

> Each step in the pipeline gets to augment the request, abort the request, or do nothing.
